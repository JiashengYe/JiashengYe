# ## Question 1: Estimating $\pi$ [8 marks]
# 
# Consider the 3 following formulas:
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# (1) \qquad &\prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{4n^2}{4n^2-1} = \frac{\pi}{2} \\
# (2) \qquad &\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n n!^2}{(2n+1)!} = \frac{\pi}{2} \\
# (3) \qquad &\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n(n+1)(2n+1)} = \pi - 3
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# Each of these formulas can be used to compute the value of $\pi$ to arbitrary precision, by computing as many terms of the partial sum or product as are required.
# 
# **1.1** Compute the sum or product of the first $m$ terms for each formula, with $m = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 30$.
# 
# Present your results graphically, using 2 plots, both with the total number of terms on the x-axis.
# 
# - The first plot should display the value of the partial sum or product for different numbers of terms, and clearly indicate the exact value of $\pi$ for reference.
# - The second plot should display the absolute value of the error between the partial sum or product and $\pi$, with the y-axis set to logarithmic scale.

# **1.2** If you did not have access to e.g. `np.pi` or `math.pi`, which of these 3 formulas would you choose to efficiently calculate an approximation of $\pi$ accurate to within any given precision (down to machine accuracy -- i.e. not exceeding $\sim 10^{-16}$)?
# 
# Explain your reasoning in your own words, with reference to your plots from **1.1**, in no more than 200 words.
# 
# **[3 marks]**

# üìù _Use this cell to answer **1.2**_
# 
# I think the **Second formula** is more accurate to approxiamte $\pi$.
# Since we know that the value of log decreases with the value inside the log, and from the second plot, we can see that the log value of the Second formula is much smaller than other two formulas when n=30. And also after n=30, it still decreses constantly and it means it approaches $\pi$ more and more closer, but for other two formulas, there are about to convergent when n increases.

# ## Question 2: Numerical Linear Algebra [12 marks]
# 
# A **block-diagonal matrix** is a square matrix with square blocks of non-zero values along the diagonal, and zeros elsewhere. For example, the following matrix A is an example of a block-diagonal matrix of size $7\times 7$, with 3 diagonal blocks of size $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$, and $2 \times 2$ respectively:
# 
# $$
# A =
# \begin{pmatrix}
# 1 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & -2 \\
# 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 3
# \end{pmatrix}.
# $$
# 
# 
# **2.1** The code below creates a block-diagonal matrix with random non-zero values between 0 and 1, where all blocks have identical size. Study the following documentation sections:
# 
# - [`scipy.linalg.block_diag()` - SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.block_diag.html)
# - [`numpy.split()` - NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.split.html)
# - [Unpacking Argument Lists - Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists)
# 
# Then, write detailed code comments in the cell below to explain **each line** of code, in your own words.

# - a NumPy vector `b` of length $mn$.
# 
# Your function should solve the block-diagonal system $Ax = b$, by solving **each sub-system $A_i x_i = b_i$ separately**, and return the solution as a NumPy vector `x` of length $mn$. You should choose an appropriate method seen in the course (e.g. `np.linalg.solve()`) to solve each sub-system.

# - Use the function `random_blocks()` from **2.1** to generate a list of $m$ random matrices of size $n\times n$.
# - Use the function `np.random.random()` to generate a random vector `b` of length $mn$.
# - Use your function `linsolve_block_diag()` from **2.2** to solve the system $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a block-diagonal matrix of size $mn \times mn$, with diagonal blocks given by the output of `random_blocks()`. Measure the computation time needed to solve the system.
# - Use the function `block_diag()` from `scipy.linalg` to form a NumPy array `A` of size $mn \times mn$, representing the block-diagonal matrix $A$.
# - Solve the full system $Ax = b$, using the same method you used in **2.2** for each individual sub-system. Measure the computation time needed to solve the system.

# From the plot, when N and M are increasing, the error is decreasing. Also, we see that four lines are becoming to stright horizontal lines after N = 50 approximately, so it means that the errors do not change a lot after N = 50 with fixed M. 
#  If M and N are up to 500, there may have the error of $10^{-5}$. The plot is asymmetric because the surface is not symmetric in $\mathcal{D}$.
